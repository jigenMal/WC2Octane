# WC2Octane
One-click import of World Creator terrains into Octane Render Standalone.

This is a script for Octane Render Standalone (https://home.otoy.com/render/octane-render/). It will automatically import a terrain generated by World Creator 2 (https://www.world-creator.com).

# Prerequisites
This script works on Windows. I think it can be easily ported to other platforms, but for the time being it's Windows-only.
The script uses the Image Magick library () to edit textures.
